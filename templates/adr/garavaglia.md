## Context

This section describes the forces at play, including technological, political, social, and project local. These forces are probably in tension, and should be called out as such. The language in this section is value-neutral. It is simply describing facts

## Assumptions

Clearly describe the underlying assumptions in the environment in which you’re making the decision—cost, schedule, technology, and so on. Note that environmental constraints (such as accepted technology standards, enterprise architecture, commonly employed patterns, and so on) might limit the alternatives you consider

## Decision

This section describes our response to these forces. It is stated in full sentences, with active voice. "We will …"

## Decision Drivers

Outline why you selected a position, including items such as implementation cost, total ownership cost, time to market, and required development resources’ availability. This is probably as important as the decision itself

## Consequences

This section describes the resulting context, after applying the decision. All consequences should be listed here, not just the "positive" ones. A particular decision may have positive, negative, and neutral consequences, but all of them affect the team and project in the future

## Links

a link to other ADR if needed. Mandatory in case the status is Superseded. the form should be [link type] [ADR #]

## Notes

Because the decision-making process can take weeks, we’ve found it useful to capture notes and issues that the team discusses during the socialization process

## Decision record template by Francesco Garavaglia - v1.0

This is the architecture decision description template that I started to use in my projects.
It is based on architecture decision description template published in ["Architecture Decisions: Demystifying Architecture" by Jeff Tyree and Art Akerman, Capital One Financial](https://www.utdallas.edu/~chung/SA/zz-Impreso-architecture_decisions-tyree-05.pdf).
